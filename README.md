# Inspector Source UI
### What is this??
The inspector ui is useful for computers or school computers that have system that blocks the `Inspect` button.

### Did you create this?
Sorry, but I didn't create this. I was trying to spread it so that it can be successful... 

Credits the them, I guess...

### How to use?
To use this, simply copy this down, or go to the `source` file...
```
javascript:(function () {     var script =  document.createElement('script');    script.src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/eruda";     document.body.appendChild(script);    script.onload = function () {         eruda.init()     } })();
```
Then, create a bookmark an paste the copied code into the URL.
And simply, press it!

There's a button in the down-right corner of your site.
Press it to open up the inspector!

You can explore anything in the inspector! (The only thing you can edit is the `Console`. Sorry...)
